# CoBlog - Server Side

CoBlog is a dynamic blogging platform designed to empower users to co-write and collaborate in real-time. Whether you're sharing personal stories, experiences, or creative content, CoBlog allows multiple users to seamlessly edit a blog together, just like Google Docs. The platform's real-time collaboration features make it perfect for teams, writers, or anyone looking to share their thoughts collectively.

This repository contains the server-side code for the CoBlog application. It provides the backend functionality for managing users, handling blog posts, and facilitating real-time collaboration.
